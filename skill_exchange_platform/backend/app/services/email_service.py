"""
Email notification service using Gmail SMTP (SSL, port 465).

Usage:
    from app.services.email_service import send_email
    await send_email("recipient@example.com", "Subject", "<h1>Body</h1>")

Credentials come from environment variables:
    EMAIL_ADDRESS   – Gmail address (sender)
    EMAIL_PASSWORD  – Gmail App Password

Fails gracefully: if credentials are missing or SMTP fails, the error is
logged but never propagated – the calling endpoint stays unaffected.
